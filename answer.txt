1. Top-Level Containers
Top-level containers are the base components that house other elements in a GUI application:

AWT:

Includes Frame, Dialog, and Applet.
These are heavyweight components that rely on the native operating system's GUI elements, making them less flexible and platform-dependent.
Swing:

Includes JFrame, JDialog, and JApplet.
Swing components are lightweight, meaning they are rendered entirely by Java, providing platform independence and support for pluggable look-and-feel, offering more customization.
2. Component Class Names
Swing components build upon AWT components and offer enhanced functionality. Their class names are typically prefixed with "J" to distinguish them:

Element	AWT Component	Swing Component
Button	Button	JButton
Label	Label	JLabel
Text Field	TextField	JTextField
Checkbox	Checkbox	JCheckBox
Radio Button	Checkbox within a CheckboxGroup	JRadioButton
Menu Bar	MenuBar	JMenuBar
Scroll Pane	ScrollPane	JScrollPane
Panel	Panel	JPanel
3. Additional Features in Swing
Swing introduces new components like JList, JTable, and JComboBox, which have no direct counterparts in AWT. These components provide more flexibility and functionality out of the box.
